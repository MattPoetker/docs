Have a custom model or voice with one of the providers? Or an enterprise account with volume pricing?

No problem! You can bring your own API keys to Vapi. You can add them in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) under the **Provider Keys** tab. Once your API key is validated, you won't be charged when using that provider through Vapi. Instead, you'll be charged directly by the provider.

## Transcription Providers

Currently, the only available transcription provider is `deepgram`. To use a custom model, you can specify the deepgram model ID in the `transcriber.model` parameter of the [Assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant).

## Model Providers

We are currently have support for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. This includes services like [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), [AnyScale](https://www.anyscale.com/), [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/), or your own server.

To use one of these providers, you can specify the `provider` and `model` in the `model` parameter of the [Assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant).

You can find more details in the [Custom LLMs](/customization/custom-llm/fine-tuned-openai-models) section of the documentation.

## Voice Providers

All voice providers are supported. Once you've validated your API through the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai), any voice ID from your provider can be used in the `voice.voiceId` field of the [Assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant).

## Cloud Providers

Vapi stores recordings of conversations with assistants in the cloud.  By default, Vapi stores these recordings in its
own bucket in Cloudflare R2.  You can configure Vapi to store recordings in your own bucket in AWS S3, GCP, or
Cloudflare R2. 

You can find more details on how to configure your Cloud Provider keys here:

  * [AWS S3](/providers/cloud/s3)
  * [GCP Cloud Storage](/providers/cloud/gcp)
  * [Cloudflare R2](/providers/cloud/cloudflare)
